Developer Documentation
=======================

Documentation for the C++ source code is `generated by Doxygen <doxy/index.html>`_.

This is not intended as an API reference, as it includes internal stuff. If you
just want to *use* OpenQL, it's strongly recommended to use it from Python,
because OpenQL's internals change a lot. Nevertheless, you *can* use it
straight from C++. To do that, first make sure you're familiar with the Python
API, then look at the examples folder of the repository to see more or less how
the API calls map, and only then look in the Doxygen documentation for details.
